What is Git?

Git is a version control system that helps track changes in code,
collaborate with others, and revert to earlier versions if something breaks.


Step 1: Initialize Git
Create a new local Git repository inside your project folder.

git init

Step 2: Add Files to Staging Area
To include your files in the next commit:

git add .

git add test.py

Step 3: Commit Your Changes
A commit saves your progress with a message explaining what you changed.

git commit -m "Added simple calculator program"

STEP 4: Pushing changes to the Github Account
git push origin master
