What is Generative AI?

Generative AI refers to systems that can create new content — text, images, code, or music — 
by learning patterns from large datasets.

Examples include:
ChatGPT (OpenAI) — Text, reasoning, code generation
Gemini (Google) — Multimodal text, image, and code generation
DeepSeek — Efficient AI model for developers
Claude (Anthropic) — Reasoning and summarization tasks, good with code generation

What is an LLM?

A Large Language Model (LLM) is a deep learning model trained on vast text data.
It understands context, grammar, logic, and intent to generate human-like responses.
Example:
Input: “Explain recursion in simple terms.”
Output: try on ChatGPT



How LLMs Work (Simplified)

1.Training Data: Billions of text examples.
2.Tokens: The model breaks text into small units (like words or subwords).
3.Context Window: The model predicts the next word based on previous ones.
4.Prompt Engineering: Developers use smart prompts to guide the model’s behavior.

Why LLMs Matter in Software Development
1.Code generation & completion (e.g., GitHub Copilot)
2.Debugging & refactoring assistance
3.Documentation & test generation
4.Automation of repetitive programming tasks
