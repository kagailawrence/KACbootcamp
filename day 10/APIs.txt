What is an API?

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a way for your program to talk to
another service using code.
When we use an LLM API, we send a prompt (input) and receive a response (output).

Typical API Flow

Send Request → Your app sends a message to the AI model.
Model Processes → The LLM interprets and generates a response.
Receive Response → Your app displays or uses that text.


Best Practices for AI API Integration
Do’s:

    Always keep your API key secret (use environment variables).
    Handle network errors gracefully (use try/except or try/catch).
    Limit requests to avoid hitting API quotas.
    Log all prompts and responses for analysis (optional) during Development.


 Don’ts:

    Don’t expose keys in public repositories.
    Don’t rely blindly on AI outputs — verify them. read and read and read the just to be safe
    Don’t spam APIs — respect rate limits. wait for random waiting sec before making the next request
