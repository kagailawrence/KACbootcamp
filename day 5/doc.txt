What Is Modular Code?

Modular code means breaking a large program into smaller, reusable, and organized parts
 (modules or files).
Each module handles one specific task — making code easier to read, test, and maintain.

Why Modular Code Matters
Improves readability.
Makes debugging easier.
Encourages reusability.
Enables teamwork — different people can work on separate modules.
