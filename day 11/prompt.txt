What is Prompt Engineering?
Definition

Prompt Engineering is the practice of designing and refining inputs (prompts)
to get useful, accurate, and reliable outputs from AI models
(like Gemini, DeepSeek, or ChatGPT).
It’s how you communicate with the model effectively 
you’re giving it instructions in plain language, but with technical precision.


Simple Example
Bad Prompt:
Write Python code.

Good Prompt:
Write a Python function that reads a JSON file of students’ names and scores, calculates
the average, and prints the top 3 students with their grades.


Types of Prompts
| Type               | Description                          | Example                                                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Instructional**  | Directs the model to perform a task. | “Explain this Python code line by line.”                               |
| **Creative**       | Asks for content generation.         | “Write a product description for a smart lock.”                        |
| **Analytical**     | Asks the AI to reason or summarize.  | “Summarize this code block in plain English.”                          |
| **Conversational** | Maintains ongoing dialogue.          | “Continue from where you left off explaining the class inheritance.”   |
| **Structured**     | Requests formatted output.           | “Return the output as a JSON object with fields name, age, and score.” |




Developer-Focused Prompt Examples

| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Code Generation** | “Write a Python script to parse a CSV file and store results in PostgreSQL.”     |
| **Refactoring**     | “Refactor this code to follow clean architecture and modular design principles.” |
| **Debugging**       | “Explain why this Python function throws a KeyError and suggest a fix.”          |
| **Documentation**   | “Generate concise documentation and docstrings for this django API.”              |
| **Testing**         | “Write 3 unit tests for this function using pytest.”    




Techniques for Writing Effective Prompts
Technique #1 — Be Clear & Specific

Bad:“Write code for login.”
Good:“Write a secure login system in Node.js using JWT authentication, including input validation and error handling.”


Specificity guides the model’s scope and format.



Technique #2 — Provide Context

Tell the model who it is and what role it’s playing.

“You are a senior Python developer. Explain this Flask route to a beginner.”

Context improves accuracy and tone.




Technique #3 — Set the Output Format

“Return the result as JSON with keys: status, explanation, and example_code.”

AI responds best when told how to format the output (text, list, table, JSON, etc.).



Technique #4 — Give Examples (Few-Shot Prompting)

“Here is one example input and output. Use the same style for the next one.”

This helps the model learn your pattern quickly.




Technique #5 — Chain Prompts (Prompt Chaining)

Break complex tasks into smaller prompts.

1.“Explain what this code does.”
2.“Now refactor it to improve readability.”
3.“Finally, generate docstrings for each function.”

This step-by-step chaining produces far better results than one massive prompt.


Technique #6 — Use Constraints

You can control tone, style, and scope.
“Explain this function in 3 sentences or less.”
“Write JavaScript code only — no explanations.”                         |


AI Behavior Control — Roles & Constraints

| Role          | Example Prompt                                                                |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Teacher**   | “You are a programming instructor. Explain decorators in Python.”             |
| **Reviewer**  | “You are a senior engineer reviewing my code for best practices.”             |
| **Debugger**  | “You are a debugging assistant. Find logical errors in this function.”        |
| **Architect** | “You are a software architect. Suggest a better file structure for this app.” |

Nb:By defining the AI’s role, you narrow its focus and improve precision.
